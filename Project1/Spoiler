<h1>"The Force Awakens" Spoilers</h1>
  <p>Below you will find some basic spoilers from the movie. If you have not seen the movie I would not read any further to spare you some pain and anger from finding out what exactly happens in the movie before you even see it.</p>

<h2>Kylo Ren</h2>
  <p>This new evil villian is the Darth Vader of the movie if you could not tell from his mask and red saber. The real shocking truth to this guy is he was once a Jedi and was trained by Luke Skywalker. Much like his grandfather Darther Vader, he turned to the dark side and caused Luke to go into hiding because of his actions. The even crazier part is this is Hans Solo and Princess Leia's SON. The even crazier part is that towards the end of the movie he has a showdown with his father and when you think he may turn back to the light he take his saber and kills his father. With that no more Hans Solo.</p>

<h2>Finn</h2>
    <p>Finn is the typical hero we have seen in Luke and Obi Wann. The crazy thing is that at the beginning of the movie we see a very strange storm trooper who seems to have emotion killing innocent people. Later we come to find out that this is our hero Finn. He decides to escape the First Order and help a prisoner named Poe escape the carrier and start a new life. It is here that he discovers Rey and they become good friends. When he tries to leave her The First Order captures her and it is a race to rescue her from their ship. We do not know if Finn will train to be a Jedi but man it sure looks like he might.
<h2>The Ending</h2>
  <p>The climax of this movie is similar to a previous one in which they destory The DeathStar.The First Order has developed a devastating weapon that can wipe out a planet with ease. It charges by the sun and The Resistance figures out their planet is the next target. At this point Hans, Chewy, and Finn are already on The Order's planet resucing Rey. The Resistance decides to send Poe and othe pilots out to destroy the weapon that sits on the core of the planet. Once Rey is rescued her and Finn try to find their way back to the Millenium Falcon to get home. Before they can get there Kylo Ren encounters them wounded and an epic fight ensues. Meanwhile, the pilots are able to destory the weapon and an implosion of the planet occurs as Rey is fighting Kylo Ren. Rey is able to injur Ren and escape as the crust breaks apart. The First Order is sent reelign as the heros, minus Hans, return home. R2D2 has been in a sleeping state since Luke disappeared.
