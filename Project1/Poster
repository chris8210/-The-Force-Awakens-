  <h2>A Little Insight Into The Movie</h2>
    <p>This movie was a bit disappointing in my opinion. If you are looking for a really not obvious story line I am just going to warn you that it can be very predictable. Still, I was very impressed with the overall acting and action in it. Personally I belive that you will love it. You have always been a big Star Wars fan, and after watching this I have also become a huge one too! From beginning to end it was packed with action and adventure. Of course I was a little disappointed with some apsects of the movie but you will find that out if you dare later.</p>

<h2>A New Jedi Awakens</h2>
  <p>Episode 7 Was in my personal opinion one of the best ones yet.The beginning immediately started off making viewers question exactly who the characters are and why they are trying to proctect some vital information from the . Kylo Ren gives an dark performance that matches that of any Darth Vader. He evil is purely magnified onto the screen and it is awesome. BB8 is introduced as a new bot that is owened by the best Pilot of the Resistance Poe. You must remember this movie is set almost 30 years after episode 6. Luke Skywalker has gone AWOL and noone can find him. Apparently there is a map that can pinpoint his location and it is up to the Resistance and Luke's sister Leia to find him before the evil First Order does. I liked that this movie followed classic characters but also introduced new ones that will become apart of the next two movies. The relationship between BB8, Finn, and Rey was wonderful. These three really played their roles and impacted the movie positively as they fought to end the First Order. Hans Solo and Chewbacca also help make this movie feel like it truly is the original cast 30 years later. The evil of The First Order was phenemonal and their actions were truly dark. Overall they storyline was somewhat predictable and reminded me of Episode 4. The action was perfect and the ending left you wanting more. Unfortunatley we have to wait for quite awhile to see where the story goes. Ultimately The Force Awakens was one of the best films I have seen this year.</p>
